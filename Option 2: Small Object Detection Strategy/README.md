# Problem
the task is about detecting tiny metal **screws** (10x10) pixels from high resolution image(4K) and the problem is tandard detection models (YOLO/SSD) often
fail because they resize images to smaller dimensions(640x640) and making the screws disappear.

# Proposed solution (Tiling / SAHI)


# Handling split objects (overlap)


# Edge device trade-offs

# Simple pseudo-code

# Conclusion
